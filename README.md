# CoinHarvest - Demo Preview

This is a **demo preview** of the fake digital earning and cryptocurrency platform: **CoinHarvest**.

**CoinHarvest** is a fictional platform where users earn "Carrots" and crypto by completing quests, playing games, watching fun videos, staking, and swapping tokens in an all-in-one dashboard.

## 🚨 This is 100% fake: no real crypto, no real earning, just a UI mockup!
